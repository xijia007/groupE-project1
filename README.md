Implement a product management system

There are two types of users in the system, one is a regular user, the other is an admin user. Each user type has different authorizations. Regular users can only select a product and add it to cart. Admin users can do everything regular users do, they can also edit/create/remove a product.

In real life, for example a B2C platform like Amazon, Walmart, Target. You can imagine the admin users are the product vendors, they can maintain the system to update their available products in stock. You can imagine the regular users are the regular customers that buy products. Company wants to save money and the system is designed to be shareable with two types of customers - vendors as internal customers and regular external customers.
